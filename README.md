## 🏡 **Predicting High-Occupancy Short-Term Rentals: A Machine Learning Approach for Property Investment Decisions**

This project was completed  as a final project for my +Masters programme in Machine Learning and A.I. 
It dives into the world of **Serviced accommodation listings in Essex** with the goal of assisting a holiday lettings company select profitable properties to invest in based on historical Airbnb listing data. 

My next steps is to continue to expand the data set and improve the feature engineering and machine learning. I would also like to try and deploy this in some way! In the meantime, I would be grateful for any feedback for improvements - 
You can email me at techtorty@gmail.com

### 🧠 Project Objective

A holiday lettings company is on the lookout for promising properties across Essex to purchase. They are seeking data insights to select properties that can earn the highest income. 

The aims of this project are:
- identify the features that mostly correlates with occupancy rates and annual revenue
- build a machine learning model that predicts which types of properties achieves the highest occupancy rates and revenue potential. 

### 📈 The Data

The data is retrieved from real data acquired from PriceLabs (https://www.pricelabs.co), a subscription-based database often used by property investors that provides professionally managed datasets for existing and potential Airbnb businesses.

### 🛠️ Phase 1 : Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis

This first phase analysis will focus on the following:
- **Data cleaning**: To manage missing data, fixing outliers, handling duplicates etc.
- **Pre-processing and transformation**: Merging datasets, Encoding and transforming columns as needed.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### Tools and Requirements
Jupyter Notebook with Python 3.13
The following python modules and libraries are required:
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- Seaborn
- Scikit Learn (sklearn)
- Scipy.stats.mstats

### Files within the Repostory:
- data: contains 2 .csv files containing dataset
- masters_assignment_1.ipynb  : this is the main source code file. Contains code for data cleaning, analysis, visualisation and explanations.
- project_document pdf : this document details the summary of the assignment.


### Instructions
1. Download all data files and Jupyter Notebook from the repository
2. Import the .csv files into local drive. Ensure the file paths are amended accordingly in the Jupyter Notebook
3. run the .ipynb file within Jupyter Notebook.
   
## Phase 2 Instructions
> The main source file is [masters_assignment_final_avrilchilds.ipynb](masters_assignment_final_avrilchilds.ipynb)
> You may wish to view the project document [masters_assignment_final_prof_doc.pdf](masters_assignment_final_proj_doc.pdf) for a summarised view of the project. 

### Tools and Requirements
Jupyter Notebook with Python 3.13
The following python modules and libraries are additionally required:
-  scikit-learn==1.4.2 (*Note: install downgrade for scikiet-learn for keras compatibility*)
-  scikeras
-  tensorflow

 ### 📈Data
 Download the cleaned data [data_cleaned.csv](data_cleaned.csv) within the data folder from phase 1, if  you are running the workbook from Phase 2. This means that you do not have to run the whole project from the beginning. If you would like to run the project from the beginning, please follow instructions from the start of this README document.
 
Check that the data folder path is correct in the Jupyter notebook. 

 ### Running the code
 The code can be run directly from phase2 (section 5) onwards within the Jupyter notebook.
